# RPGMenu [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joblo2213/RPGMenu.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joblo2213/RPGMenu)

RPGMenu is a addon for [BetonQuest](https://github.com/Co0sh/BetonQuest) which allows server operators to simply create thier own guis
by using events and items from BetonQuest.  
It currently is under development so there are no finished builds there yet.
