# RPGMenu Wiki

RPGMenu is a addon for [BetonQuest](https://github.com/Co0sh/BetonQuest) which allows server operators to simply create thier own guis by using events and items from BetonQuest.  
Nearly everything can be done by using this addon, from simple selection, over warp systems, guis listing open quests to information dialogs that display player stats.
For all this you only have to be familliar with BetonQuests events/conditions system, no coding skills are required.
Everything can be created by simply creating and modifying config files in YAML.

**This wiki contains information about the latest release. Documentation for the latest commits can be found in the [docs directory](https://github.com/joblo2213/RPGMenu/tree/master/docs/).**
